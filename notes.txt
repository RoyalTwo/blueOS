## NOTES & THOUGHTS

- Spending a lot of time thinking about how to combine the bootloader with the kernel. The bootloader should probably be binary, but the kernel should be ELF and that seems hard to link together.
    - Actually, do I even need to link the kernel and the bootloader?
    - If I'm writing the bootloader myself, why does the kernel need to be linked?
        - I could just have the kernel be its own thing, just loaded onto the same disk
        - Then I can load the kernel from the bootloader
        - I could just mush them together into a disk image
            - Tetris OS seems to do that
    - If I do just slam the kernel onto the same disk, I need to write a file system later and the bootloader will have to read it (at least enough to load second stage)
    - Reading some online resources, it seems I'm right, most of the time the bootloader is NOT linked with the kernel
        - This means I don't have to worry about linking until I'm linking the kernel together
